# Numerical-Methods

This repository contains numerical methods  than can be applied to chemical engineering problems in mass and energy balances, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer, separations, and chemical reactor analysis. Topics include: computer calculations and round-off error, algorithms and convergence, finding roots by bisection or Newton's method, curve fitting and interpolation/extrapolation, numerical integration and differentiation, numerical solution of initial value problems, stiffness, matrices and determinants, matrix properties, special matrices, methods of solution for systems of linear equations by matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, solving systems of non-linear equations, and applications to unit operations. Algorithsm created in Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and Newton-Raphson.
